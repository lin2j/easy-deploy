Easy Deploy is a plugin I developed, inspired by the Alibaba Cloud Toolkit, to facilitate my service deployment during 
the development process. Compared to the Alibaba Cloud Toolkit, my plugin has significantly fewer features, as many of 
the ACT functionalities are unnecessary for me and make it somewhat bloated.

Therefore, I focused only on developing the functionalities I care about: server management and the deployment process. 
I named this plugin "Easy Deploy" in the hope that it will help developers simplify the deployment steps in their 
development process. I will continually optimize it and enhance its features.

This is also the first Idea plugin I have developed. Many issues were resolved gradually through extensive searching, 
especially those related to Swing, a technology I haven't used in years. Additionally, the encapsulation by IntelliJ 
and the varying UI across different versions posed some challenges. Therefore, if you choose to download and use it now,
please feel free to submit issues to me.
